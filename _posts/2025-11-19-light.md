light enters me<br>
i absorbe<br>
interpreted impulses<br>
chemical changes in my light sensitive lining<br>
a bright image<br>
prolonged stimulation<br>
saturation desensitizes<br>
now<br>
i can see you in a blank wall,<br>
that part of me desensitized by the bright image does not respond<br>
to this new light input<br>
whats left<br>
a dark area that matches the original shape?<br>
though i don’t understand<br>
i try to restore the equilibrium of the pigment and its components<br>
